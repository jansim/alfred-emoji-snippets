# Alfred Emoji Snippets 😊📋️

A node.js script to easily generate up-to-date snippets for Alfred to quickly find and paste emojis. An already built `alfredSnippets` file can be downloaded under *Releases*.

Originally inspired by the [Alfred Emoji Pack](http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/) which sadly isn't updated anymore. The icon is made using Emojis designed by [OpenMojis](https://openmojis.org), an open-source emoji and icon project licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
